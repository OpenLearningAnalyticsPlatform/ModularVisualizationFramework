# OpenLAP-Visualizer

## Introduction
The OpenLAP-Visualizer component is responsible for generating client-side visualization codes. This repository contains the "core" logic of the OpenLAP-Visualizer component. 

The "core" logic ranges from the endpoints which make up the REST API of the OpenLAP-Visualizer component to Services and the DataAccess layer. To have a detailed view on how the OpenLAP-Visualizer looks like, please refer to this <a href="https://github.com/OpenLearningAnalyticsPlatform/OpenLAP-Architecture/wiki/4.4.1.-Visualizer:-Module-Views">link</a>. 

The clients of the OpenLAP-Visualizer can use its REST API to perform various operations such as upload new visualizations as stated in the guide <a href="https://github.com/OpenLearningAnalyticsPlatform/OpenLAP-Visualizer-Framework">here</a>, or
perform CRUD operations on `VisualizationSuggestions` and `VisualizationMethods`. For REST API or source code documentation have a look at the <a href="https://github.com/OpenLearningAnalyticsPlatform/OpenLAP-Visualizer-Core/tree/master/apidocs">apidocs</a> folder of the source code.
