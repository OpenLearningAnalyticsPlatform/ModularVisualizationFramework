# OpenLAPVisualizer

The OpenLAP-Visualizer-Core project contains "core" logic of the Visualizer component. The code in this repository contains the endpoints which make up the REST API of the Visualizer component. 
In addition, this project also includes the Service and DataAccess layer of the Visualizer.
At runtime the clients can use the REST API of the Visualizer to perform various operations such as upload new `VisualizationFrameworks` as stated in the guide <a href="https://github.com/OpenLearningAnalyticsPlatform/OpenLAP-Visualizer-Framework">here</a>, or
perform CRUD operations on Visualization Suggestions and Methods. 

For REST API or source code documentation have a look at the <a href="https://github.com/OpenLearningAnalyticsPlatform/OpenLAP-Visualizer-Core/tree/master/apidocs">apidocs</a> folder of the source code.
